# Weather-App
Weather app in Node.js using the Openweathermap API

## Hosted at: https://palm-butter-constrictor.glitch.me/


Weather forecasting is very necessary for our daily lives. It helps us to prepare and make plans depending on the expectations. Many weather stations are placed around the world fetching real-time weather elements’ data.

## Get the API
Visit https://openweathermap.org/ and create a new account or sign in if you already have an account.
Click on your account name link found on the top right side of the navigation bar. On the drop-down menu, select ‘My API keys’. You can generate one with a new name or use the default one provided.

Make sure that it is not seen by anyone for security reasons. Also, don’t save it directly in your application.

In our App I have only displayed few data but you can tap into the data to display other terms too.
